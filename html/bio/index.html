          Shakespeare was a guy who lived from about April 23, 1564 to April 23, 1616. He was
          a wonderful playwright, accomplished poet, and pretty okay actor. He wrote many plays
          that unhappy adolescents must read in high school, including:
        </p>
        <li>Hamlet</li>
        <li>Macbeth</li>
        <li>A Midsummer Nights Dream</li>
        <li>Romeo & Juliet</li>
